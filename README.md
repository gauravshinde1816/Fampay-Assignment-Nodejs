### âœ“ Basic Requirements:

âœ… Server should call the YouTube API continuously in the background (async) with some interval (say 10 seconds) for fetching the latest videos for a predefined search query and should store the data of videos (specifically these fields - Video title, description, publishing datetime, thumbnails URLs and any other fields you require) in a database with proper indexes.

âœ… A GET API that returns the stored video data in a paginated response sorted in descending order of published datetime.

âœ… It should be scalable and optimized.

### Bonus Points:

âœ… Add support for supplying multiple API keys so that if quota is exhausted on one, it automatically uses the next available key.

âœ… Make a dashboard to view the stored videos with filters ( in-built DRF filters provided ) and sorting options (optional)

âœ… Optimise search api, so that it's able to search videos containing partial match for the search query in either video title or description. - Ex 1: A video with title _`How to make tea?`_ should match for the search query `tea how`

### Instructions:

- You are free to choose any search query, for example: official, cricket, football etc. (choose something that has high frequency of video uploads)
- Try and keep your commit messages clean, and leave comments explaining what you are doing wherever it makes sense.
- Also try and use meaningful variable/function names, and maintain indentation and code style.
- Submission should have a README file containing instructions to run the server and test the API.
- Submission should be done on GitHub Externship Portal.

### Reference:

- [YouTube data v3 API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)
- [Search API reference](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list)
- To fetch the latest videos you need to specify these: type=video, order=date, publishedAfter=<SOME_DATE_TIME>
Without publishedAfter, it will give you cached results which will be too old
